I’ve worked in a variety of roles and companies, first as a freelance designer making promotional material for small companies and then I started learning code and programming. I worked as a UI developer for a marketing agency, collaborating closely with the UI/UX Design Lead  to translate high fidelity mockups into functional code using HTML, CSS and JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Then I started getting interested in designing user interfaces and experiences and later in product design. I have a bachelor degree in Graphic Design so it was easy for me to make that transition.","my_story2":"From that moment on I’ve been working as a product designer at consulting agencies, startups and also doing some freelancing myself. I love working with different kinds of clients because I never get bored. I pay a lot of attention to details and always strive towards delivering the best solutions, not only for customers but also for business. I love branding design as well, I think a key aspect as a product designer is being able to see the project from start-to-end: from recognizing an opportunity and understanding the customer's needs through to final delivery.","my_story_tech":"On a personal level, technology has led me to a new world that I had never imagined.
